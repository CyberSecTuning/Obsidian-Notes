Summary of Activities:
Tuning a BMW ECU is an exciting and daunting task that requires the right tools and knowledge to follow the correct steps to safely access and modify the engine’s control data. In this guide, we’ll explore how to use two reliable tools: MS4X Flasher for partial reads, which is ideal for partial reads through the OBD port, enabling quick access to specific calibration data. With MS4X, you can perform necessary tweaks without engaging in full ECU access, making it convenient for simpler updates and re-calibrations. This method allows for program adjustments while preserving the bootloader section, ensuring that the ECU’s core structure remains intact. For more advanced tasks, the JM Garage software provides complete ECU access by enabling “boot mode.” This method requires grounding pin 104 on the ECU’s C167 processor, bypassing flash protections to enable full reads and writes. Boot mode is essential when you need unrestricted access, such as for cloning, deep parameter adjustments, or VIN and security code updates. This approach ensures you have a comprehensive backup of the ECU’s entire 512KB flash memory, covering all program, calibration, and boot-loader data. Whether you’re looking to fine-tune specific parameters or fully customize your BMW E46’s ECU, these tools offer a versatile pathway to unlock its potential safely. This guide will help you understand the steps and precautions needed to make precise modifications to your ECU setup.


Description of Learning Completed: 
To begin the tuning process we first must acquire a full read of our ECU data to create a backup file in case any problems occur while tuning or preforming a firmware update. 
Items needed:
- OBD2 cable
- Laptop using Win OS
- Ms4x Flasher installed
- JMGarage installed
- Battery Charger (optioinal)
- Ground wire for boot mode pin. (Random copper wire)

Once the vehicle is in ignition 2 position and OBD2 is plugged into the laptop we are ready to start. 

- If you are doing it in the car, connect a battery charger to ensure vehicle stays above 12V.
    
- Connect OBD cable to car and computer and turn car to ignition position 2. If bench setup, turn on power supply.
- Open MS4x flasher
	- In previous guides, Ms4x flasher has been used to do full reads. In recent windows updates when using Ms4x flasher for full reads, it will occasionally respond with "Error "Could not read the data from the control unit" 
	- This issue could be caused by operating system configuration. Users have reported windows 11 may cause communication issues with during full reads. 
	- For this example, using Ms4x flasher on windows 11, would not allow a full read. 

- Make sure MS4x Flasher identifies ECU as MS43 by clicking "Identify"
    
- Hit “full read” or "Partial Read" for tuning and wait for it read.
    
- If Ms4x is successful, Hit “save binary”

	- Save this binary in a safe place as a backup.

- For maximum tuning capabilities it is recommended to update the vehicles firmware to the most recent version which is: MS430069, for the BMW e46 M54B30. 
	- This firmware update is necessary to unlock new features and bug fixes. Also improves stability and performance along with compatibility with Tuning tools. 
	- It is important you select the correct .bin file corresponding to your vehicles engine specifications.

- Once new firmware is downloaded, in Ms4x flasher go to the next tab down in the flasher and hit “load binary”

- Select BIN file for the 069 firmware that you downloaded from MS4x.net and hit open
	-  Hit full write then wait for it write. It may be recommended to do a full flash using jmgarage in boot mode if you are experiencing communication issues. 
 
- Once file has been written go back up to the first tab in the flasher and do a full read
 
- Once full read is done, hit save binary

- Open tuner pro
	- Hit XDF tab
	-  Go down and hit Select XDF
	-  Select Siemens_MS43_430069_512k.xdf that you downloaded from MS4x.net definition files
	
-  Once that is loaded, hit XDF tab again
	-  Hit Select XDF
	-  Select your 069 community patchlist you downloaded from MS4x.net

-  Once those two XDF’s are in there, select File tab
	-  Hit Open Bin
	-  Open your newest Bin file that you saved after the firmware update
	
-  Hit the + next to patches
	-  Select [PATCH] Immobilizer bypass
	-  Hit Apply patch
	-  Hit apply
	
-  Next select [PATCH] Immobilizer Bypass DTC Fix
	-  Hit Apply patch
	-  Hit apply
	
-  Now select file tab
	-  Hit Save Bin As, then name it something you can identify as EWS DELETED
	
-  open MS4x Flasher
	-  Deselect Safety check enabled under bottom tab(settings)

-  Second tab down select “load binary”
	-  Open your EWS DELETED Bin file.
	
-  Select full write

- Once fully written turn off power supply and with battery disconnected install DME in car. Should fire up, could have an extend crank. If you are using the car as a power I would suggest just pulling negative battery cable, turning the ignition back to 0. Then connect the battery back and try starting it.
### JMgarage boot-mode method

Due to Ms4x errors during full reads,  JMgarage was specifically created to work in boot mode and allow full reads and flashes. To enter boot-mode on Ms43 ECU's, pin 104 needs to be shorted to allow the ECU to enter boot-mode allowing full unrestricted access to the ECU's memory. As pin on the C167 processor needs to be grounded when powering up the ECU it is best to perform these steps with a bench setup, but it can be performed in the car as well but extra care has to be taken that nothing is accidentally shorted. To prevent connection issues verify in the device manager on the computer that the OBD cables com port is configured with a latency timer of 16 milliseconds.

To begin the process of entering boot mode:
- Ensure that the ignition is off and open the ECU compartment under the hood. Disconnect all connectors to the ECU and remove the ECU from the compartment.

- Remove the protective covers on the ECU by undoing the four bolts.

- Place the ECU circuit board on an ESD safe surface on bench or near ECU connections in the car. For this example we do not have a current bench setup. 

- Connect the computer to the OBD plug in the car.

- Start JMGarage boot mode programming software.

- Short pin 104 on the C167 processor to ground with a piece of wire or something similar on the pin showed in the screenshot below.
![[Pasted image 20241105004119.png]]

- Power up the ECU and keep shorting pin 104 for approximately 10 seconds. If you are working in the car you can power up the ECU by turning the ignition key to position 2 and then connecting the X60001 connector which powers the Vcc/+12V, Ground, and CAN-Bus low/ TCU K-line functions.

- After 10 seconds have passed remove the shorting wire from pin 104 (do not leave it connected as that will result in a corrupted read/write)

- Try connecting with the boot mode programming software. If connection failed power down the ECU and redo step 4 to 9.

- After connection is successful you can read and write to the ECU.


During the read/write process JMGarage can sometimes state that it's not responding. If this happens do not panic the program is still working in the background so just wait until it finishes.

In the event of something still going wrong during the read/write process like a laptop shutting down then power down the ECU and redo step to short pin 104 and load JMgarage .

It is recommended to always start with performing a full read of the ECU so that you have a backup that can be restored if anything goes wrong. Also remember to correct checksums on all binaries you write to the ECU.
